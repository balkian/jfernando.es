abstract = "Extracting opinions and emotions from text is becoming more and more important, especially since the advent of micro-blogging and social networking.
Opinion mining has become particularly popular and now gathers many public services, datasets and lexical resources.
Unfortunately, there are few available lexical and semantic resources for emotion recognition that could foster the development of new emotion aware services and applications.
Some of the barriers for developing such resources are the diversity of emotion theories and the absence of a common vocabulary to express emotion.
This article presents a semantic vocabulary, called Onyx, intended to provide support to represent emotions in lexical resources and emotion analysis services.
It follows a linguistic Linked Data approach, it is aligned with the Provenance Ontology, and it has been integrated with lemon, an increasingly popular RDF model for representing lexical entries.
This approach also means a new and interesting way to work with different theories of emotion.
As part of our work, Onyx has been aligned with EmotionML and WordNet-Affect.

    abstract = "Online services are no longer isolated. The release of public APIs and technologies such as web hooks are allowing users and developers to access their information easily. Intelligent agents could use this information to provide a better user experience across services, connecting services with smart automatic behaviours or actions. However, agent platforms are not prepared to easily add external sources such as web services, which hinders the usage of agents in the so-called Evented or Live Web. As a solution, this paper introduces an event-based architecture for agent systems, in accordance with the new tendencies in web programming. In particular, it is focused on personal agents that interact with several web services. With this architecture, called MAIA, connecting to new web services does not involve any modification in the platform.",

    abstract = "Sentiment and Emotion Analysis strongly depend on quality language resources, especially sentiment dictionaries.  These resources are usually scattered, heterogeneous and limited to specific domains of application by simple algorithms.  The EUROSENTIMENT project addresses these issues by 1) developing a common language resource representation model for sentiment analysis, and APIs for sentiment analysis services based on established Linked Data formats (lemon, Marl, NIF and ONYX) 2) by creating a  Language Resource Pool (a.k.a. LRP) that makes available to the community existing scattered language resources and services for sentiment analysis in an interoperable way.  In this paper we describe the available language resources and services in the LRP and some sample applications that can be developed on top of the EUROSENTIMENT LRP.",

    abstract = "This project aims to introduce an event-based architecture for intelligent agents, inaccordance with the new tendencies in the Evented Web.The reason for this change is that agent communication is no longer suitable for theinmense amount of data generated nowadays and its nature. At least, not for their usein evolving scenarios where data sources interact without previous conguration. This isexactly what the precursors of the Live Web envision, and it is beginning to show in the newgeneration of evented applications, which enable customized interactions and a high level ofcommunication between dierent services.The proposed architecture shown in this document, called Maia, is based on a centralpiece or event router, which controls the ow of information/events to and from the connectedentities. These entities can be either event-aware agents or simply data sources andsubscribers. Thus giving a higher exibility than current technologies and easing the developmentof advanced systems by not requiring the complexity associated with agent systemsin all of the nodes.To demonstrate the feasibility and capabilities of the Maia architecture, a prototype hasbeen implemented which is also explained in detail in this document. It is based on the eventdrivenI/O server side JavaScript environment Node.js for the event routing components,and adapted Jason BDI agent platform as an example of a subscribed multi-agent system.Using this prototype, the benets of using Maia are illustrated by developing a personalagent capable of booking train tickets and that combines access to services, linked data andcommon sense reasoning.",

Nevertheless, current sentiment indicators are still silos that cannot be combined to get better insight about the mood of different communities. In this article we propose a Linked data approach for modelling sentiment and emotions about financial entities. We aim at integrating sentiment information from different communities for providers, and complements existing initiatives such as FIBO. The approach has been validated in the semantic annotation of tweets of several stocks in the Spanish stock market, including its sentiment information.",

This paper presents a new ontology, called Onyx, that aims to become such a standard while adding concepts from the latest Semantic Web models. In particular, the ontology focuses on the representation of Emotion Analysis results. But the model is abstract and inherits from previous standards and formats. It can thus be used as a reference representation of emotions in any future application or ontology. To prove this, we have translated resources from EmotionML representation to Onyx. 
        We also present several ways in which developers could benefit from using this ontology instead of an ad-hoc presentation. Our ultimate goal is to foster the use of semantic technologies for emotion Analysis while following the Linked Data ideals.",
