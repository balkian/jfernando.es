	abstract = {The growing popularity of public APIs and technologies such as web hooks is changing online services drastically. It is easier now than ever to interconnect services and access them as a third party. The next logical step is to use intelligent agents to provide a better user experience across services, connecting services with smart automatic behaviors or actions. In other words, it is time to start using agents in the so-called Evented Web. For this to happen, agent platforms need to seamlessly integrate external sources such as web services. As a solution, this paper introduces an event-based architecture for agent systems. This architecture has been designed in accordance with the new tendencies in web programming and with a Linked Data approach. The use of Linked Data and a specific vocabulary for events allows a smarter and more complex use of events. Two use cases have been implemented to illustrate the validity and usefulness of the architecture.},

This year two challenges have been proposed, which we have addressed with the design and development of a modular system that is adaptable to different contexts. This system employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine-learning technologies, relying also in previously developed technologies in our research group. In particular, we have used a wide number of features and polarity lexicons for sentiment detection. With regards to aspect detection, we have relied on a graph-based algorithm. Once the challenge has come to an end, the experimental results are promising.},

To tackle this problem, previous works propose the use of the NLP Interchange Format (NIF) as both a common semantic format and an API for textual sentiment analysis. However, that approach creates a gap between textual and sentiment analysis that hampers multimodality. This paper presents a multimedia extension of NIF that can be leveraged for multimodal applications. The application of this extended model is illustrated with a service that annotates online videos with their sentiment and the use of SPARQL to retrieve results for different modes.},

For this task we propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture composed of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells followed by a feedforward network. The architecture makes use of two different types of features: word embeddings and sentiment lexicon values. The recurrent ar- chitecture allows us to process text sequences of different lengths, while the lexicon inserts directly into the system sentiment information. The results indicate that this feature combination leads to enhanced sentiment analysis performances.},

	abstract = {The appearance of new Deep Learning applications for Sentiment Analysis has motivated a lot of researchers, mainly because of their automatic feature extraction and representation capabilities, as well as their better performance compared to the previous feature based techniques. These traditional surface approaches are based on complex manually extracted features, and this extraction process is a fundamental question in feature driven methods. However, these long-established approaches can yield strong baselines on their own, and its predictive capabilities can be used in conjunction with the arising Deep Learning methods. In this paper we seek to improve the performance of these new Deep Learning techniques integrating them with more traditional surface approaches based on manually extracted features. The contributions of this paper are: first, we develop a Deep Learning based Sentiment classifier using the Word2Vec model and a linear machine learning algorithm. This classifier serves us as a baseline with which we can compare subsequent results. Second, we propose two ensemble techniques which aggregate our baseline classifier with other surface classifiers widely used in the field of Sentiment Analysis. Third, we also propose two models for combining deep features with both surface and deep features in order to merge the information from several sources. As fourth contribution, we introduce a taxonomy for classifying the different models we propose, as well as the ones found in the literature. Fifth, we conduct several reproducible experiments with the aim of comparing the performance of these models with the Deep Learning baseline. For this, we employ four public datasets that were extracted from the microblogging domain. Finally, as a result, the experiments confirm that the performance of these proposed models surpasses that of our original baseline using as metric the F1-Score, with improvements ranging from 0.21 to 3.62 \%.},

However, to date, adding this functionality was a tedious, costly, and time consuming effort, and one should look for different tools that suits one's needs, and should provide different interfaces to use those tools. The MixedEmotions toolbox leverages the need for such functionalities by providing tools for text, audio, video, and linked data processing within an easily integrable plug-and-play platform. These functionalities include: (i) for text processing: emotion and sentiment recognition, (ii) for audio processing: emotion, age, and gender recognition, (iii) for video processing: face detection and tracking, emotion recognition, facial landmark localization, head pose estimation, face alignment, and body pose estimation, and (iv) for linked data: knowledge graph. Moreover, the MixedEmotions Toolbox is open-source and free. In this article, we present this toolbox in the context of the existing landscape, and provide a range of detailed benchmarks on standardized test-beds showing its state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, three real-world use-cases show its effectiveness, namely emotion-driven smart TV, call center monitoring, and brand reputation analysis.},

Opinion mining has become particularly popular and now gathers many public services, datasets and lexical resources.

Some of the barriers for developing such resources are the diversity of emotion theories and the absence of a common vocabulary to express emotion. This article presents a semantic vocabulary, called Onyx, intended to provide support to represent emotions in lexical resources and emotion analysis services. It follows a linguistic Linked Data approach, it is aligned with the Provenance Ontology, and it has been integrated with lemon, an increasingly popular RDF model for representing lexical entries. This approach also means a new and interesting way to work with different theories of emotion. As part of our work, Onyx has been aligned with EmotionML and WordNet-Affect.},

	title = {{MAIA}: {An} {Event}-based {Modular} {Architecture} for {Intelligent} {Agents}},
	abstract = {Online services are no longer isolated. The release of public APIs and technologies such as web hooks are allowing users and developers to access their information easily. Intelligent agents could use this information to provide a better user experience across services, connecting services with smart automatic behaviours or actions. However, agent platforms are not prepared to easily add external sources such as web services, which hinders the usage of agents in the so-called Evented or Live Web. As a solution, this paper introduces an event-based architecture for agent systems, in accordance with the new tendencies in web programming. In particular, it is focused on personal agents that interact with several web services. With this architecture, called MAIA, connecting to new web services does not involve any modification in the platform.},

	title = {Design and {Implementation} of an {Agent} {Architecture} {Based} on {Web} {Hooks}},
	abstract = {This project aims to introduce an event-based architecture for intelligent agents, inaccordance with the new tendencies in the Evented Web.The reason for this change is that agent communication is no longer suitable for theinmense amount of data generated nowadays and its nature. At least, not for their usein evolving scenarios where data sources interact without previous con guration. This isexactly what the precursors of the Live Web envision, and it is beginning to show in the newgeneration of evented applications, which enable customized interactions and a high level ofcommunication between di erent services.The proposed architecture shown in this document, called Maia, is based on a centralpiece or event router, which controls the  ow of information/events to and from the connectedentities. These entities can be either event-aware agents or simply data sources andsubscribers. Thus giving a higher  exibility than current technologies and easing the developmentof advanced systems by not requiring the complexity associated with agent systemsin all of the nodes.To demonstrate the feasibility and capabilities of the Maia architecture, a prototype hasbeen implemented which is also explained in detail in this document. It is based on the eventdrivenI/O server side JavaScript environment Node.js for the event routing components,and adapted Jason BDI agent platform as an example of a subscribed multi-agent system.Using this prototype, the bene ts of using Maia are illustrated by developing a personalagent capable of booking train tickets and that combines access to services, linked data andcommon sense reasoning.},
